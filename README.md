--This README.md has been created for the purpose of being part of an e-portfolio. It doesn't actually have anything to do with this web server.

This dynamic web server functions as a multi-page site that allows access into a US energy usage database. There are three pages, each displaying data from a different perspective. The first, year, displays all the data from a specific year. It consists of a graph and table. The table shows data from each state, and how much eneregy from each source they used that year. The graph displays the table data. The second page, state, shows all the data from a specific state. It shows how much of each eneregy source has been used over time. The graph also displays the table data. The third page, energy, shows all the data for a specific energy source. The table shows each state's usage of that energy source across time. The gragh also displays the table data. Users can switch between pages and select an inividual year, energy source, or state. This allows for easy access and displaying of the data on a table and graph.
